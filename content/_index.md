# Amazon ECS Workshop for AWS Fargate

In this workshop, we will configure GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, VPC, ALB, ECS,
Autoscaling, and log aggregation using a framework called [Mu](https://getmu.io) to
launch microservices on AWS Elastic Container Service.

We will launch a frontend, and multiple backend services and will explore how you
might adopt this workflow in your environment.

To get started, please ensure the [prerequisites](/prerequisites.html) are met.
