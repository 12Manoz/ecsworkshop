Opinionated tooling is designed to guide you down a path that is considered a _best practice_.
Additionally, since "best practice" is the default, the amount of code we maintain is
dramatically reduced. Rather than writing hundreds of lines of CloudFormation ourselves, we
can start with a smart set of defaults, and just fill in a few blanks, and customize only the parts
that we want changed.
