Opinionated tooling is designed to guide you down a path that is considered a _best practice_.
Additionally, since _best practice_ is the default, the amount of code we maintain is
dramatically reduced.

Rather than writing hundreds of lines of CloudFormation to orchestrate ECS, ECR,
EC2, ELB, VPC, and IAM resources ourselves, we can start with a smart set of defaults, and just
fill in a few blanks, customizing only the parts that we want changed.
