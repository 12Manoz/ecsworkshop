### We will use [Mu](https://getmu.io) for this workshop. Why Mu?

#### <i class="fa fa-cloud fa-lg"></i> It's Cloud Native<br>
Mu knows when to stay out of the way.  Mu only uses AWS resources for deploying your microservices.

#### <i class="fa fa-rocket fa-lg"></i> Continuous Delivery<br>
Mu uses CodePipeline and CodeBuild to continuously test and delivery your microservice to production.

#### <i class="fa fa-gear fa-lg"></i> Polyglot<br>
Mu doesn't have a favorite language.  If you can get your microservice running with a Dockerfile, then mu can help!</p>

#### <i class="fa fa-codepen fa-lg"></i> Stateless<br>
Mu knows you might not need it anymore.  Mu doesn't have any servers or databases running anywhere.  Mu leverages CloudFormation to manage state for all AWS resources.</p>

#### <i class="fa fa-code fa-lg"></i> Declarative<br>
Mu makes sure you get what you want.  You declare your configuration in a YAML file and commit with your source code.  Mu takes care of setting up your AWS resources to meet your needs.</p>

#### <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> Open Source<br>
Mu is MIT licensed, so you can use it commercially.  Mu is always looking to improve, so please consider contributing!</p>
