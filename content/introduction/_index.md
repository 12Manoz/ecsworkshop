# Welcome!

This workshop is designed to educate engineers that might not be familiar with Fargate, ECS,
and possibly even Docker container workflow.

We will learn by _doing_ and will build a typical 3 tier polyglot microservice
stack like you may work with in your organization.

Our structure will be: 1 repo -> 1 pipeline -> 1 container -> 1 service

We will use many AWS services, including CodePipeline, CodeBuild, ECS, ECR, Fargate, Route53 and ALB.
