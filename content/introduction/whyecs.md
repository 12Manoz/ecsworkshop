Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container
orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale
containerized applications on AWS. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install and operate
your own container orchestration software, manage and scale a cluster of virtual machines, or
schedule containers on those virtual machines.
