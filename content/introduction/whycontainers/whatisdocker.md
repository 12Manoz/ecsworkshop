- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
- Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
    - Whether you are running on Linux, Windows, or macOS, you can run containers!
