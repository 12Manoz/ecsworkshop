Containers are powerful way for developers to package and deploy their applications. They are lightweight and provide a consistent, portable software environment for applications to easily run and scale anywhere. Building and deploying microservices, running batch jobs, for machine learning applications, and moving existing applications into the cloud are just some of the popular use cases for containers.
Some other benefits of containers include:

- Speed
- Workload Isolation
- Single artifact to test from local to production, avoid drift
